# Xiaomi Mi 10 (UMI, Snapdragon 865)

This device port follows unified upstream `88513176b1e96ecf0b764cd62c6f4e6ac71345e3`.
The previous UMI kernel and userland history is retained by the integration merge.

## Source isolation

All UMI implementations live here. Shared upstream sources in `xnu/files/`,
`userland/src/`, `wifi/lx/`, the shared loader, and `xnu/hakios.patch` remain
unchanged. `upstream-templates.sha256` records their contents;
`python3 devices/xiaomi-mi-10/prepare.py verify` checks that invariant.

`overlays/xnu/files/` contains the UMI-specific driver variants and helpers.
`xnu-device.patch` adds their build entries and startup calls to the generated
Apple source tree; it is applied after upstream's patch. It also retains the
32 MiB peripheral mapping window required by the working UMI port.

`overlays/wifi/` selects QCA6390 PCIe/MHI and retains UMI authentication fixes.
`overlays/userland/` holds UMI firmware packaging, Bluetooth startup, and its
controller compatibility library. The build scripts stage these into private
copies under `out/xiaomi-mi-10/`; they do not replace upstream templates.

The loader and UEFI source port are likewise device-local (`loader/`, `uefi/`).
The supplied device tree is `prebuilt/device-tree.dtb`. Firmware, generated Apple
identity headers, build output, captures, and credentials remain outside git.

## Building

Set `THEOS` to a toolchain directory containing `sdks/iPhoneOS16.5.sdk`; prepare
XNU's dependencies with upstream `xnu-deps/setup.sh` when needed. Keep your own
extracted iOS files in `sysimage/`, and the phone's firmware in the ignored
`fw-gpu/`, `fw-audio/`, `fw-haptic/`, `fw-wifi/`, and `fw-bluetooth/` directories.
UMI Bluetooth needs `htbtfw20.tlv` and `htnv20.bin`; its firmware is embedded only
in the generated kernel tree. No vendor firmware is committed here.

```sh
devices/xiaomi-mi-10/build-wifi.sh
devices/xiaomi-mi-10/build-kernel.sh -j8 -k
devices/xiaomi-mi-10/build-loader.sh
devices/xiaomi-mi-10/build-userland.sh
```

The kernel is `out/xiaomi-mi-10/xnu/BUILD/obj/DEVELOPMENT_ARM64_BCM2837/mach.development.bcm2837`.
The images and loader are `out/xiaomi-mi-10/{root.apfs,system.apfs,loader.efi}`.
Build or supply a UMI UEFI image implementing the existing XNUP hook:
`UEFI_FD=/path/to/SILICIUM_UEFI.fd`, with the device-local UEFI source in `uefi/`.
The UMI FD is 3 MiB at `0x9fc00000`; packaging rejects another model's DTB.

## RAM boot

```sh
devices/xiaomi-mi-10/run.sh reload
devices/xiaomi-mi-10/run.sh ramdisk
XL_SECS=1800 devices/xiaomi-mi-10/run.sh run
```

`run.sh` uses a generated, device-selected copy of upstream `xl`. It shares the
phone lock with the earlier UMI workspace and refuses to fall back to a POCO
kernel or loader. Nothing is flashed. The default arguments are in `boot.args`;
they keep touch, keys, haptics, audio, GPU, scan synchronization, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
and all eight cores. Stock maximum GPU frequency remains 587 MHz.

For live USB logs, use `bootcpu=7 cpus=7` instead of the eight-core pair in
`boot.args`. `XL_FOLLOW=5 XL_FOLLOW_KEEP=1` retains timing snapshots. `thermal=2`
is an optional comparison mode: CPU caps are not applied, while sensors,
pressure reporting and the emergency shutdown stay active. It is not a default.

The upstream compositor currently uses OpenGL ES through Mesa. This update
follows upstream's unfinished Metal status; it does not claim a Metal compositor.
The UMI display variant retains the validated staging/cache fixes and releases
source ownership after staging so rendering can overlap panel presentation.

## Validation

The kernel, Wi-Fi object, Mesa, userland images and UMI loader build. The actual
scan-reader register-model test passes (`python3 devices/xiaomi-mi-10/tools/test-display.py`).
The template checksum test passes. The Android RAM-boot package builds with the
supplied UMI device tree and UMI UEFI layout. The updated kernel and matching
iOS images booted on UMI; touch initialized, the GPU rendered apps at its
587 MHz setting, and the audio DSP and Wi-Fi interface initialized. The user
confirmed that the build works, while scrolling skips/freezes remain. This
source migration does not claim to resolve that remaining performance issue.
