 * What the drivers share, kept apart from any one of them, so that each can be left out of the kernel on its own

 *
 *   the locks      of the hardware several drivers take turns at: the PMIC arbiter (the buttons, the flashlight, the
 *                  camera's regulators, the PMIC survey), the always-on processor's mailbox, the shared memory's
 *                  allocation and RPMh's sequencer (the Wi-Fi, audio DSP and modem bring-ups, the touch screen's
 *                  supply), and the SMMU's free match registers (Wi-Fi, sound, camera, modem). They were in
 *                  hakios.buttons.c and hakios.wifi.c, which the others then needed in the kernel to link.
 *   kern.hakios    the sysctl node the drivers hang theirs under (it was hakios.battery.c's)
 *   the list       of the drivers this kernel was built with: sysctl kern.hakios.drivers, and a line in the boot log,
 *                  so that a run says what was in it (hakios.drivers.h is made by tools/hakios-config.py kernel).
