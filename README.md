# HakiOS

English · [中文](README.zh.md) · [Українська](README.uk.md)

**Apple's open-source Darwin kernel (XNU, xnu-8796.121.2) on Android phones with a Qualcomm SoC**, the way Android is Linux on
phones: a boot loader of its own, drivers of its own, a configuration system and a version of its own. The same kernel runs in
QEMU with nothing of Apple's and nothing of any phone's (`make qemu-open`).

**Documentation: [docs/](docs/index.md)**, also on the project's website (`hakios-web`). Start with [Getting started](docs/getting-started/index.md), [Port a device](docs/porting/index.md) or the
[Architecture](docs/concepts/architecture.md).

## What works

| | POCO X5 Pro 5G (`redwood`) | QEMU `virt` |
|---|---|---|
| Lock screen, home screen, Control Center, the stock apps | yes | yes (slow: the CPU is emulated) |
| Touch, multitouch, buttons | yes | yes |
| All 8 CPU cores, the big one at 2.4 GHz | yes | no |
| GPU rendering on Adreno (OpenGL ES through Mesa) | yes | no |
| Speakers, microphone, the battery's level | yes | sound only |
| Wi-Fi, cameras, vibration | yes | network only |
| `/private/var` kept across reboots, Sileo, SSH | yes | no |
| Metal | partly: a device Metal loads; buffers and libraries; nothing drawn yet | partly |
| Cellular | partly: the modem is up, the SIM bound, the network seen; no registration yet | no |
| Bluetooth, charging under this kernel, Apple's services | no | no |

Every part, as each device's own `device.conf` records it: [Devices](docs/devices/index.md). The rows about the lock screen and the
apps describe what happens when you add layer 2 below yourself.

## The three layers

1. **The open core**: the kernel port, the loader, the drivers, the tools. All source, in these repositories.
2. **What you put on top**: the kernel can start a user space that you supply. It was built so that it can start the iOS 16.5
   user space, which you lay out yourself from files you download from Apple; nothing of it is shipped, and nothing is
   circumvented to get it. Whether you may do that, and whether you want to, is your decision.
3. **Apple's services** (activation, Apple ID, iCloud, the App Store): not supported and not a goal.

By default the loader goes into RAM through `fastboot boot`, the system lives in RAM for a session, and a reboot brings the phone
back to its own Android. The one thing written by default is the loader's own log (a few KB) to the `logdump` partition; with
`ufs_write=1` the kernel writes only to a partition `darwin` that you create yourself. This is a research bench, not a ROM.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shimoku74/hakios.git hakios
cd hakios
make doctor           # what this machine lacks, and what to do
make qemu-open        # the open kernel in QEMU: nothing of Apple's, nothing of a phone's
```

iOS in QEMU (Linux, 12 GB of disk, Apple's IPSW downloaded for you), and a session on the phone:
[QEMU](docs/getting-started/qemu.md), [On the phone](docs/getting-started/phone.md).

```sh
make redwood_defconfig   # the phone's configuration: the common kernel + the SC7280's + the phone's own
make kernel              # the kernel with the drivers that configuration builds
make phone SECS=600      # a 10-minute session on the phone, in RAM
```

## Repositories: common, SoC, device, UEFI

| Repository | What |
|---|---|
| [hakios](https://github.com/shimoku74/hakios) | **common**: the kernel port, every common driver, the loader, user space, the tools, this documentation, and `devices/qemu` |
| [hakios-sc7280-common](https://github.com/shimoku74/hakios-sc7280-common) | the Qualcomm SC7280 family (Snapdragon 778G): its configuration fragment and the drivers it builds |
| [hakios-redwood](https://github.com/shimoku74/hakios-redwood) | POCO X5 Pro 5G: its defconfig, status, UEFI platform, firmware script |
| [hakios-uefi](https://github.com/shimoku74/hakios-uefi) | HakiOS's UEFI: Mu-Silicium with HakiOS's boot path, banner and name |
| [hakios-web](https://github.com/shimoku74/hakios-web) | the website, with this documentation and the FAQ |

`devices/manifest.conf` in the common repository names each one and the revision it is at; `tools/hakios-device.py sync` clones them
into `socs/`, `devices/` and `uefi/`. [How the repositories fit](docs/porting/repositories.md).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shimoku74/hakios.git && cd hakios
tools/hakios-device.py sync      # the SoC, device and UEFI repositories, at the revisions the manifest names
```

A device of your own is a repository over the common one: `tools/hakios-device.py new` makes it from the phone's own device tree,
with every phone driver left out until it is ported. Each driver is an option of the kernel's own configuration (`CONFIG_HAKIOS_*`,
XNU's `options` and `conf/files`), so a device's defconfig builds exactly the drivers it has.
[Port a device](docs/porting/index.md), [Drivers in the configuration](docs/drivers-config.md).

## What is in the repository, and what never is

In it: only our own code and data: the patch to Apple's open-source XNU (`xnu/hakios.patch`, APSL 2.0) and our files, the boot
loader, our programs and libraries, the tools, `prebuilt/` (built from this source; the loader **without** any Apple data:
`make loader` makes the one that starts iOS, on your machine, from your own IPSW), and the device and SoC directories.

Never in it: any file of iOS (you build the system image on your machine from the IPSW, which `sysimage/fetch.sh` downloads from
Apple's public servers without decrypting or circumventing anything); the phone's firmware (pulled from your own phone into
`fw-*/`, which git ignores); keys, certificates, activation, or anything that would make the phone pass as an iPhone to Apple.

## Independent, and Apple-free at the core

HakiOS is an independent research project. It is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple**;
"iOS", "iPhone", "XNU" and "Apple" are named only to describe what the code works with. The core
kernel, the boot loader and the open tools build and run with nothing of Apple's:

```sh
make qemu-open      # the open kernel + a placeholder loader + a tiny raw-syscall user space, in QEMU
```

No IPSW, no iOS user space, no firmware. Booting the stock iOS user space (`make qemu`,
`make phone`) is an optional path that needs the IPSW and the phone's firmware, which you supply
from your own device.

## Licenses and the legal side

My code is under the license of the files it changes: the XNU patch under the Apple Public Source
License 2.0 (Apple publishes XNU under it; the terms are met: changes are published as source,
notices are kept), the rest as the file headers say. iOS, its images, Apple's trademarks and the
phone's firmware belong to their owners, are not in this repository and are not distributed by me;
everyone takes them from their own phone and their own IPSW. "iOS", "iPhone" and "Apple" are
named only to describe what the code works with. If you believe a file here infringes anyone's
rights, open an issue and I will remove it.

The detail is in separate files: `LEGAL.md` (what is and is not distributed, and the limits of
these statements), `COMPLIANCE.md` (how the APSL 2.0 and other terms are met, and the items still
to verify), `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` (every third-party component with origin and license), and
`NOTICE` (the short canonical list). None of this is legal advice.

hakios is an experimental project focused on bringing ios to android hardware. our goal is to make hakios free and accessible to everyone.
