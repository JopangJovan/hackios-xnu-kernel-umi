"""Check every air.* arithmetic operation the corpus uses against a reference.

The corpus exercises each operation only incidentally: a shader that calls
air.fast_round once and a hundred other things tells us the module translated,
not that the rounding is right. One of these was wrong for a week -- fast_round
was lowered to nir_fround_even, which is rint, and the two differ at every
half-way value -- and nothing in the 456-module corpus could have shown it,
because no module's output was ever compared with a number computed any other
way.

So the operations are tested one at a time, on inputs chosen to break them:

  - air2nir --list over the corpus gives the declarations that are actually
    used (78 arithmetic ones today). Apple's vocabulary in AGXCompilerCore has
    137 names; the ones no module calls are not translated and not tested, and
    this prints that difference rather than hiding it.
  - for each declaration a fragment shader is generated that calls it on
    constant arguments and returns the result as its render target, llvm-as
    assembles it, and `air2nir --eval` folds it. Nothing is read from the
    corpus but the list of names.
  - the reference is this file's Python, which for every exactly-defined
    operation is the IEEE result rounded once to the shader's precision.

What a disagreement means, in order of what it is most likely to be: the
lowering in air_intrinsics.c is the wrong NIR opcode (fast_round); the
reference here is the wrong Metal semantics; NIR's constant folder differs
from libm. The third has never happened yet.

What this does NOT prove, and no amount of it will:

  - The reference for a transcendental is this machine's libm, not Apple's and
    not the Adreno's. Metal's `fast_` prefix *permits* a lower-precision
    implementation, so the printed difference for fast_sin is a measurement,
    not a verdict. Those are reported separately and are never counted as
    exact. The only thing checked there is that the lowering picked an
    operation of the right shape.
  - NIR's constant folder is not the Adreno. A difference between what
    nir_opt_constant_folding computes for nir_ffloor and what the hardware's
    floor instruction computes would be invisible here. Checking that needs
    the phone, and for these operations it has not been done.
  - Denormals. Apple compiles with air.compile.denorms_disable, so the
    hardware may flush where this check does not. Inputs are kept normal.

# down: f16 holds integers exactly only to 2048, above which the spacing is 2.
#   2051  half way between 2050 and 2052, whose lower neighbour is odd, so
#         round-to-nearest-even gives 2052 and truncation gives 2050 -- the f16

#   2048  the last integer f16 holds exactly

# whatever about rounding. They agreed on the Adreno and that agreement was
