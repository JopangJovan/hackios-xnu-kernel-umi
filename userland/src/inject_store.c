/*
 * libredwood-store.dylib: code of ours inside appstored (see inject.c for how it gets there).
 *
 * What it is for. The App Store opens and shows LOADING for ever. The front page is a "bag" --
 * AppleMediaServices' configuration -- and AMS will not load one until it knows the storefront, the
 * number that says which country's store this device belongs to. Everything outside the process has
 * been measured and is well:
 *   - the bag itself is fetched from this phone by hand, 56 KB in half a second, and the server
 *     hands over a storefront in the bargain: "x-set-apple-store-front: 143469-2,8" from both
 *     bag.itunes.apple.com and init.itunes.apple.com (rc.jobs.store, src/net_test.m);
 *   - appstored opens no socket at all while the store spins, so nothing is failing on the network;
 *   - the storefront cannot be put on the device from another process: AMS's "local" account is not
 *     a row in accountsd at all -- a different identifier every boot -- so there is nothing to write
 *     to and nothing that would keep (src/store_test.m).
 *
 * So the storefront is not written anywhere here either. The account is made to ANSWER with one:
 * -[ACAccount ams_storefront] is the door every consumer in AMS goes through, and its neighbours are
 * taken in the same pass because different callers knock at different ones. No persistence, no
 * accountsd, nothing that outlives the process.
 *
 * And the question that is worth more than the storefront: is a bag request ever built? From outside
 * only the socket log could answer, and only negatively, over a console that drops lines. From in
 * here it can be answered positively. -[AMSBagNetworkTask _performFetchWithAttemptedCount:account:
 * storefront:] and its _queryItemsForClientInfo:... are where a request is assembled: they are not
 * replaced, only watched, and what they were called with is written down. If neither is entered,
 * nothing about the network matters and the gate is above them.
 *
 * The storefront is 143469-2,8 because that is what Apple's own bag server returned for THIS device
 * when asked with none -- a region, picked from the address the request came from. No Apple ID is
 * signed in, none can be, and the store must still refuse to install: there is nothing to buy with.
 *
 * AppleMediaServices and Accounts are not loaded yet when this library is: the methods are taken
 * when their images arrive (_dyld_register_func_for_add_image).
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERED. The storefront was the gate, and it is not the only one.
 *   entered    3 -[ACAccount ams_storefront]                     (answered 143469-2,8; was (nil))
 *   entered    3 -[AMSBagActiveAccountProvider _bagAccountForAccountMediaType:mustContainStorefront:]
 *                 mustContainStorefront:0 -> the local account, mustContainStorefront:1 -> (nil)
 *   entered    1 -[AMSBagNetworkTask _performFetchWithAttemptedCount:account:storefront:]
 *                 "BAG FETCH attempt 0, storefront 143469-2,8, account local (...)" -> a promise
 *   entered    1 -[AMSBagNetworkTask _createRequestWithQueryItems:] -> <AMSMutablePromise: ...>
 *   entered    0 -[AMSBagNetworkTask URLSessionPromise]
 *   entered    0 -[AMSURLSession dataTaskPromiseWithRequest:]
 *   entered    0 -[AMSURLSession dataTaskWithRequest:]
 *   entered    0 -[NSURLSessionTask resume]
 * So with a storefront to answer with, AMS DOES build a bag request -- that question is settled, and
 * positively, from inside. And the request never becomes a transfer: it is assembled into an
 * AMSMutablePromise that nothing ever resolves, so no session is asked for, no task is made and
 * nothing is ever resumed. Not one task is resumed in the whole daemon in a six-minute session,
 * which is why the socket log never had appstored in it. The store still shows LOADING, as it must:
 * the bag never loads.
 * Where to look next is one step further in: what that request promise waits on -- the request
 * encoder and the headers AMS adds before sending (ams_addCookiesForAccount:clientInfo:bag:,
 * ams_addStoreFrontHeaderForAccount:client:withBag:, ams_addAnisetteHeadersForAccount:type:bag:,
 * -[AMSURLSession _prepareRequest:properties:error:]). One of those never comes back.
 *
 * Two things this library learned about itself, for whoever writes the next one:
 *   - class_getInstanceMethod walks up the chain, so replacing what a class only INHERITS replaces it
 *     for everything else that inherits it too. Doing that to an NSObject category restarted
 *     appstored 31 times in one run. image_added now refuses anything the superclass answers to.
 *   - an ObjC exception ends in abort(), not in SIGSEGV, so a fault reporter that watches only the
 *     memory signals says nothing at all about the usual way a replacement of ours kills a daemon.
